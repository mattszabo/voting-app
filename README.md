# Voting app
This app is being created by following this full-stack redux tutorial: http://teropa.info/blog/2015/09/10/full-stack-redux-tutorial.html

It's exposing me to TDD with javascript, React, Redux, as well as client/server development.

The voting client was creating using create-react-app, which I've added mocha and chai to. The app has also been ejected to expose me to the boilerplate - the more code I can examine while learning the better!
